### Academic Paper Evaluation Tool based on Large Language Models

> Python web, Langchain

📅 Sep 2023 - April 2024

Developed an application to assist in evaluating the contributions of research papers based on current large language
models. Implemented the extraction of research content, methodology, and key formulae, as well as the evaluation of
overlapping contributions across multiple papers. 

### Studying the Placement of EV Charging Stations in Parking Facilities
> Python SUMO simulation

📅 Sep 2022 - May 2023

Utilized open-source data to simulate and model the parking facilities, roads, and traffic flow in the Suzhou Industrial
Park area. Analyzed various candidate locations for charging stations to optimize the placement and minimize queuing and
congestion. The related paper "Studying the Placement of EV Charging Stations in Parking Facilities" was published at the
IECON 2023 conference.
